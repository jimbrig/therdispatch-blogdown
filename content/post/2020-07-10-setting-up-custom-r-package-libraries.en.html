<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Dealing with R Packages can be a pain sometimes, especially when dealing with
development versions of evolving packages over time. Additionally, sometimes it
is necessary to revert back to an old version of a package in order to reproduce
an old project or replicate a test environment for a deployment.</p>
<p>To resolve some of the pains associated with this process, I came up with a
nice little solution, which I will explain in this post.</p>
</div>
<div id="setup-personal-libraries" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup Personal Libraries</h2>
<p>The goal is to have additional system wide libraries for <strong>Dev</strong> packages as well
as <strong>Old</strong> versions of packages, in addition to your default <code>.libPaths()</code> user
library.</p>
<p>For me this is how I set up the folders:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-07-10-setting-up-custom-r-package-libraries.en_files/dirs.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>To do this I ran the following code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dev_path &lt;- gsub(&quot;4.0&quot;, &quot;Dev&quot;, .libPaths()[1])
dir.create(dev_path)

old_path &lt;- gsub(&quot;4.0&quot;, &quot;Old&quot;, .libPaths()[1])
dir.create(old_path)</code></pre>
<p>However, we need a way for these libPaths to be accessible from R.</p>
</div>
<div id="setting-up-rprofile" class="section level2">
<h2>Setting up RProfile</h2>
<p>To do this you could utilize the Windows Environment Variable Paths
(like the default library path does), but instead I decided on a simpler
method via the <code>.Rprofile</code> startup dotfile.</p>
<p>To access your <code>.Rprofile</code> you can run <code>usethis::edit_r_profile()</code>.</p>
<p>Here are the lines of code I added to my <code>.Rprofile</code> which add these new paths as
internal R Options (so as to keep them hidden from the environment variables):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>options(
    &quot;dev_lib&quot; = gsub(&quot;4.0&quot;, &quot;Dev&quot;, .libPaths()[1]),
    &quot;old_lib&quot; = gsub(&quot;4.0&quot;, &quot;Old&quot;, .libPaths()[1])
)</code></pre>
<p>Now every time R is loaded I can access these library paths via
<code>getOption("dev_lib")</code> or <code>getOption("old_lib")</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="adding-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Adding Packages</h2>
<p>Now, we want to add some packages to the newly created <code>Dev</code> and <code>old</code> package
libraries.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say I need the old version of dplyr (v0.8.5) instead of the
current v1.0.0. I can install it into the <code>old_lib</code> via:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>remotes::install_version(&quot;dplyr&quot;, 
                         version = &quot;0.8.5&quot;,
                         lib = getOption(&quot;old_lib&quot;),
                         upgrade = &quot;never&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>and library it using:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;dplyr&quot;, lib.loc = getOption(&quot;old_lib&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Notice my use of the argument <code>upgrade = "never"</code> in my call to <code>remotes::install_version</code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, let’s say I want the development version of the <code>shiny</code> package in
my <code>dev_lib</code> to try out new features not yet on CRAN:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>remotes::install_github(&quot;shiny&quot;, 
                        lib = getOption(&quot;dev_lib&quot;), 
                        upgrade = &quot;always&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>and to library…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;shiny&quot;, lib.loc = getOption(&quot;dev_lib&quot;))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="additional-resources" class="section level2">
<h2>Additional Resources</h2>
<p>If you would like to take this idea a little further, you should look into creating
project specific libraries using the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/renv">renv</a> package.</p>
