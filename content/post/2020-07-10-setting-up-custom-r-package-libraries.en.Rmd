```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  error = FALSE,
  eval = FALSE,
  echo = TRUE
)
```

## Overview

Dealing with R Packages can be a pain sometimes, especially when dealing with 
development versions of evolving packages over time. Additionally, sometimes it 
is necessary to revert back to an old version of a package in order to reproduce 
an old project or replicate a test environment for a deployment.  

To resolve some of the pains associated with this process, I came up with a 
nice little solution, which I will explain in this post.  

## Setup Personal Libraries

The goal is to have additional system wide libraries for **Dev** packages as well 
as **Old** versions of packages, in addition to your default `.libPaths()` user 
library.

For me this is how I set up the folders:

![](/post/2020-07-10-setting-up-custom-r-package-libraries.en_files/dirs.png)

***

To do this I ran the following code:

```{r setup_dirs, eval=FALSE}
dev_path <- gsub("4.0", "Dev", .libPaths()[1])
dir.create(dev_path)

old_path <- gsub("4.0", "Old", .libPaths()[1])
dir.create(old_path)
```

However, we need a way for these libPaths to be accessible from R. 

## Setting up RProfile

To do this you could utilize the Windows Environment Variable Paths 
(like the default library path does), but instead I decided on a simpler 
method via the `.Rprofile` startup dotfile. 

To access your `.Rprofile` you can run `usethis::edit_r_profile()`.

Here are the lines of code I added to my `.Rprofile` which add these new paths as 
internal R Options (so as to keep them hidden from the environment variables):

```{r rprofile, eval=FALSE}
options(
    "dev_lib" = "C:/Users/jimmy.briggs/Computer/Program Files/User/R/win-library/Dev",
    "old_lib" = "C:/Users/jimmy.briggs/Computer/Program Files/User/R/win-library/Old"
)
```


Now every time R is loaded I can access these library paths via 
`getOption("dev_lib")` or `getOption("old_lib")`. 

## Adding Packages

Now, we want to add some packages to the newly created `Dev` and `old` package 
libraries.

For example, let's say I need the old version of dplyr (v0.8.5) instead of the 
current v1.0.0. I can install it into the `old_lib` via:  

```{r dplyr, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_version("dplyr", 
                         version = "0.8.5",
                         lib = getOption("old_lib"),
                         upgrade = "never")
```

and library it using:

```{r load_dplyr, eval=FALSE}
library("dplyr", lib.loc = getOption("old_lib"))
```

Notice my use of the argument `upgrade = "never"` in my call to `remotes::install_version`.

Alternatively, let's say I want the development version of the `shiny` package in 
my `dev_lib` to try out new features not yet on CRAN:  

```{r}
remotes::install_github("shiny", 
                        lib = getOption("dev_lib"), 
                        upgrade = "always")
```

and to library...

```{r}
library("shiny", lib.loc = getOption("dev_lib"))
```


## Additional Resources

If you would like to take this idea a little further, you should look into creating 
project specific libraries using the `renv` package.
